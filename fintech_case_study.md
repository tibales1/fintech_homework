# FinTech Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

* Esri

* Founded in 1969

* Founder - Jack and Laura Dangermon

* The company started as land-use consulting firm and then grew into one of the large software mapping companies.

* This private company is funded mostly through selling digital mapping software.


## Business Activities:

* The company can use the location, amount, and type of event of to look for fraud.

* Their customers that use this technology solution are insurance companies, law enforcement, and financial institutions. The unfair advantage     is that through the use of their in house spatial algorithms tied to fast datastores then can find fraud or alert a client to potential fraud.

* To do this they are using Hadoop


## Landscape:

* The company provides spatial business intelligence for private firms, non-profits and governmental entities

* The major trends as it relates to the finacial world are deep learning to identify financial fraud based on transactions by type, frequency,     and location

* I do not believe that there is another company that can use spatial analytics to identify fraud in real-time or find money luandering schemes.


## Results

* One impact is to alert insurance companies to potential fraudulent claims by mapping weather events to a claimants physical address.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
