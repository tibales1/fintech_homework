# FinTech Case Study - Tom Bales 

## Overview and Origin

* Esri

* Founded in 1969

* Founder - Jack and Laura Dangermon

* The company started as land-use consulting firm and then grew into one of the large software mapping companies.

* This private company is funded mostly through selling digital mapping software.


## Business Activities:

* The company can use the location, amount, and type of event of to look for fraud.

* Their customers that use this technology solution are insurance companies, law enforcement, and financial institutions. The unfair advantage
  is that through the use of their in house spatial algorithms tied to fast datastores then can find fraud or alert a client to potential fraud.

* To do this they are using Hadoop and inhouse built algorithms.


## Landscape:

* The company provides spatial business intelligence for private firms, non-profits and governmental entities

* The major trends as it relates to the finacial world are deep learning to identify financial fraud based on transactions by type, frequency, and location.

* I do not believe that there is another company that can use spatial analytics to identify fraud in real-time or find money luandering schemes.


## Results

* One impact is to alert insurance companies to potential fraudulent claims by mapping weather events to a claimants physical address.

* This company does not release much financial information. But their model for success is to market products to education entities, procure government contracts including 
  creating military products, and generally create a spatial solution for every industry in the world including financial technologies.

* There is no meaningful competitor and I find opensource technologies to be burdensome and complex to create and maintain.


## Recommendations

* I would advise the company to start a bandwith and thorouput map layer that shows connection speeds and areas of limited internet service in real-time as one
  of there Atlas mapping products with the intention of creating growth in underserved areas.

* Esri also has an environmental and social component to it and is very concerned about climate change, however, having a mapping product like this would 
  coincide with there drive to create a more equitable society.

* It would create more internet access for people which in turn can as a backbone can create more digital banking options.

* This technology would change development of fiber and wifi networks which would have an impact on society much like the printing press did.
