# FinTech Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

* Esri

* Founded in 1969

* Founder - Jack and Laura Dangermon

* The company is funded mostly through selling digital mapping software.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* The company provides spatial business intelligence for private firms, non-profits and governmental entities

* The major trends as it relates to the finacial world are deep learning to identify financial fraud based on transactions by type, frequency,     and location

* I do not believe that there is another company that can use spatial analytics to identify fraud in real-time


## Results

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
